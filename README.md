I'm currently building a website that will collect data from milesplit and similar websites to automate the collection and organization of xc and track finish times for meets and athlete's end-of-season personal times. 
The goal is for coaches to input the website url that collects that athlete's times, like milesplit, and the computer program will collect and store the data for only one school's athletes. 
Then the program will format the data into a spreadsheet for meets. 
At the end of the season the program will use the saved data to format all the meets and corresponding times an athlete participated in into a google doc for each athlete.
